 * Context Populator Filter
 * This middleware sets the current Context from req to loopback current context

 * then current context is lost after session layer handles the request
 * so it is possible to call this middleware in each of layer
 * so that callContext which is populated in pre-auth-context-populator
 * middleware can be set into loopback current context.
 * If you want to use session then this middleware needs to be configured
 * in each of phases in middleware.json.
