/**
 * This mixin is attached to BaseEntity so that it applies to all Models used in
 * the EV-FOUNDATION framework. The purpose of this mixin is as follows:
 * At creation time of (each) model, check if its definition contains a property
 * called 'cacheable', and if its value is anything other than 'false'.
 * If so, mark the model as Cacheable by adding a property with this model's name
 * to the global 'evcacheables' object.
 * The global 'evcacheables' object is used to check whether a given model is cacheable
 * or not in the modified loopback-datasource-juggler
